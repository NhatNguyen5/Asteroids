# Build an Asteroids Game

We're going to build a simple video game, based on the classic Asteroids.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ installed (see the Bookbot project for help if you don't already have this)
- The uv project/package manager
- Access to a Unix-like shell (e.g., zsh or bash)

The goal is not to teach game development or the math required for physics simulations. As a result, there are some places where you'll simply copy-paste code that we wrote for you. Don't worry about trying to understand every detail if it's not interesting to you; you will be asked to write the parts that matter most.
